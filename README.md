# Ladder Dynamics of Planetary Systems
A Geometric Dynamical Framework for Orbital Architectures
This repository contains the white paper “Ladder Dynamics of Planetary Systems: A Geometric Dynamical Framework”, which develops a unified, physics‑driven model for understanding the spacing and structure of planetary systems.

The central idea is simple but powerful:
planetary orbits naturally organize into geometric “ladders” and this structure emerges directly from Newtonian gravity coupled with disk‑driven migration.

📌 Overview
The white paper introduces a self consistent framework in which:

Orbital radii follow a geometric sequence

𝑟
𝑘
=
𝑎
0
𝑞
𝑘
Newtonian mechanics then forces corresponding ladders for:

orbital velocity

angular momentum

orbital energy

orbital period

Disk torques introduce a torque ladder and a differential migration law

A single geometric parameter, q, evolves dynamically and becomes “frozen” by migration traps

Different planetary architectures correspond to different frozen values of q

This creates a predictive, testable model for why planetary systems look the way they do.

Physical Interpretation of q

Applications to Real Systems

Kepler‑444

Implications  
Ladder structure emerges as a dynamical attractor under gravity + disk migration.

🔍 Key Insight
Planetary system architecture is governed by a single geometric parameter, 
𝑞
, whose value is shaped by disk physics and preserved by migration traps.

This framework links:

formation physics

migration dynamics

final orbital spacing

into one coherent picture.
